# Spiral Matrix Traversal in Java

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project demonstrates how to **print a 2D matrix in spiral order** using Java.  
The spiral order means starting from the top-left corner of the matrix, traversing the outer boundary, and then moving inward layer by layer until all elements are printed.

Example spiral traversal:

Matrix:
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16

Spiral Order:
1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 8 â†’ 12 â†’ 16 â†’ 15 â†’ 14 â†’ 13 â†’ 9 â†’ 5 â†’ 6 â†’ 7 â†’ 11 â†’ 10

## ðŸ§  How I Designed the Logic
I broke the traversal into **four directions** inside a loop:

1. **Top Row (Left â†’ Right)**  
   Print the first row from the current starting column to the ending column.

2. **Right Column (Top â†’ Bottom)**  
   Print the last column from the next row down to the ending row.

3. **Bottom Row (Right â†’ Left)** *(only if rows remain)*  
   Print the bottom row from right to left.

4. **Left Column (Bottom â†’ Top)** *(only if columns remain)*  
   Print the first column upwards.

After finishing one boundary, I **shrink the matrix boundaries** by moving:
- `startRow++`, `endRow--`
- `startCol++`, `endCol--`

This repeats until all elements are printed.
